To test things in the member registration form and Donation form

# Member Registration Form
1. Each field is required that means if the user leaves a field blank he/ she will be prompted to complete that field
2. Phone number and e-mail address have set patterns that means if the user enters a phone number or an e-mail address in a different format then he/ she will be prompted to match the required format
3. The submit button at the end should prompt an alert and after clicking OK, the data should be sent to the database in the back end

# Donation Form
1. This form has multiple steps and has previous and next buttons to go to one page from another, there are also circles at the bottom that indicate which page you're on and once you've completed a page the circle indicating that respective page turns green
2. All the fields are required so if the user leaves a field blank and try to go to the next page, the field will turn red-ish to prompt the user to complete it

*The $10, $20 etc. buttons don't do anything as of now
*I have set the patterns for Phone number and e-mail address but I still need to fix some things for that to work
